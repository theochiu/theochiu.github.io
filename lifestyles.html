<p style="text-indent: 45px;">
	Everyone wants to live a healthy lifestyle. Here are some quick thoughts reflecting on my lifestyle and why I chose it.
	Most young people (<30) are convinced that as long as they don't do hard drugs or are alcoholics that their lifestyle
	is healthy enough. After all, don't most college students smoke weed and drink and party on the weekends? Though their
	assertion might be <a href="https://news.umich.edu/marijuana-use-among-us-college-students-remains-at-highest-level-in-three-decades/"
	target="_blank">statistically true</a>, it is incredibly fallacious to claim that just because many people are 
	engaging in a certain activity (drinking and smoking in this case) that therefore those activites are healthy and/or 
	beneficial. 

	In fact in my experience many people claim that just because they aren't engaging in drinking and smoking that
	therefore they are living a healthy lifestyle. While it is definitely true that comparatively they are living 
	a healthIER lifestyle, it's a big leap to automatically assume that their lifestlye is, itself, healthy. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 45px;">
	But before we ask ourself what constitutes as a healthy lifestyle, we need to ask why ought people pursue a healthy
	lifestyle to begin with? If Macbeth were correct in asserting that, <i>"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
	...full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing."</i> then a concern for a healthy and good lifestyle is completely 
	arbitrary. However, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 tells us that our bodies are temples for God Himself, and therefore
	deserve the highest honor. It is from this premise, that man is charged with finding and living a healthy lifestyle.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 45px;">
	A healthy lifestyle begins with the mind and expands to the body. The mind drives the body. If the mind is weak 
	your body cannot be strong. The first step to a healthy lifestyle is to discipline the mind. Most people
	have learned to discipline their mind through school and studying, and this is a great start. People who discipline
	their mind are capable in managing their finances, their time, and other resources well. They are determined 
	and highly motivated to pursue their goals. Next a healthy lifestyle consists of disciplining the body. 
	Being overweight is a choice. If you don't believe me, consider this, can you get fat behind your own back? 
	As <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4YZiKbklAE">Ricky Gervais says</a>,
	no one in the history of the world has ever wondered whether the cause of their obesity was jogging or overeating,
	the answer is obvious. Disciplining your body consists of more than just being an appropriate weight,
	athleticism and strength play an important part of it as well. For those that question the benefits
	of strength training and muscles, there are many studies that show that
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6322789/">exercising reduces heartattacks</a>,
	and also leads to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395188/" target="_blank">longer lifespan</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 45px;">
	In the same vein, diet is also very important to a healthy lifestyle. There are many different diets out there: 
	low carb, keto, carnivore, vegan, etc. But finding the right one for you is the key. Everyone loves and hates
	different foods, and different foods react with everyone differently (ie: peanut allergies), so it's important
	to find one that works for you. A good diet also can lead to an increased lifespan and is essential since
	it plays an intimate role as the fuel for your fitness. Therefore it cannot be neglected. 
	Food is fuel, and there's a reason why sports cars need better fuel than a prius, it's the same reason
	why racecars need better fuel than a sports car. If you want your body to be performing at a high level
	it's imperative you give it the right fuel to make it run.

	For me a carnivore diet with intermittent fasting works the best. The intermittent fasting promotes cellular
	autophagy that clears my mind and reduces bloating and inflammation. Lifting and then running in a fasted 
	state also helps me clear my glycogens and burn only fat. Then a meal high in protein lets me bulk 
	and build more muscle. To conclude here is a summarized list:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Recognize the need for a healthy lifestyle stems from the commands of God</li>
	<li>Stay away from unhealthy practices: smoking, binge drinking, drug use</li>
	<li>Discipline your mind, set and achieve goals, and nurture your determination</li>
	<li>Discipline your body, pursue fitness and athleticism</li>
	<li>Make appropriate eating decisions: what to eat, when to eat, how much to eat</li>
</ol>
