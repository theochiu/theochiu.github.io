<p>Iâ€™ve been exposed to computers for most of my life, and I love programming! 
I first started programming in 7th grade when I checked out a book on Java from the library. Since then Iâ€™ve taken some classes,
watched some youtube videos, and checked out a ton more books to learn as much as a possibly can.</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy playing guitar, piano, and drums. <a href="music.html">Music</a> is a large part of my life and 
Iâ€™m constantly looking for new songs to enjoy.</p>
