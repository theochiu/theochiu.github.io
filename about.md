Thanks for visiting my page! In addition to my engineering exploits I also thoroughly enjoy 
making music (and listening to it), cars, and photography. 

#### Music

I've been playing music since I was 4, when my mom introduced me to the world of music. I started out 
with piano lessons, but eventually I taught myself how to play guitar, drums, and bass as well!
I love rock and roll, country and alternative. Wanna hear what I've been listening to lately? 
I regularly maintain several (too many) 
[Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/theochiu).

#### Cars

I think the moment I realized how much I loved cars I knew I should study engineering. 
For me, it's more than just going fast, cars are special in that they are the perfect 
merge of beauty and elegant engineering. 

I've taken auto shop in high school and I really enjoyed the process of restoring an
old BMW 2002. It's amazing to think that even in the 60's and 70's with the limited
technology available at the time they were able to build such a masterpiece.

And that's the legacy that engineers and designers continue today. There is a 
strong balance between beautiful design work and solid engineering. For example
most of the curves in the BMW I8 were designed after a water droplet to optimize
aerodynamic. The engineers observed how a water droplet would change shape 
when falling to optimize the car to be less air resistant. 

#### Photography

I've been really getting into photography lately, hopefully I'll have more to post
and add later :)
