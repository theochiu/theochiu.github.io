As you might already know (from the title in your browser) my name is Theodore Chiu! I'm a programmer studying engineering at
<a href="http://engineering.purdue.edu" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>. I'm from Palo Alto, and I attended <a href="http://shschools.org" target="_blank">Sacred Heart Prep</a>, graduating in 2017.

I've been exposed to computers for most of my life, and I love programming! 
I first started programming in 7th grade when I checked out a book on Java from the library. Since then I've taken some classes,
watched some youtube videos, and checked out a ton more books to learn as much as a possibly can.

In my spare time I enjoy playing guitar, piano, and drums. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}music.html">Music</a> is a large part of my life and 
I'm constantly looking for new songs to enjoy.
