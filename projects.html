							Heroes Jobs
						</a>
					</strong>

						 - I worked as an CS intern for the summer at <a href="http://heroes.jobs" target="_blank">
							Heroes</a>, a small startup in San Francisco. Primarily, my work involved <a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/airbnb">growth hacking</a>,
							a way to leverage social networking and automation to gain users for free. I created libraries to "hack" instagram and other social medias, where I spearheaded a process
							of following and unfollowing across different social media to get the users attention. My work lead to a sharp increase of user acquisition (downloads)
							as well as better user retention.

						Stanford Liquid Handling Robot</a>
					</strong>
				

					 - While working as an intern at <a href="https://lhr.learningtech.org/whatitis/" target="_blank">Learningtech</a>, I helped
					develop and optimize their liquid handling robot designs. When I wasn't teaching students programming, I was 
					working on PID tuning the robot, as well as writing usable documentation for teachers so that the robot 
					could be implemented in classrooms.

					</strong>
					- I worked as an intern at
					<a href="http://med.stanford.edu/scsnl.html" target="_blank">Stanford's Cognitive & Systems Neuroscience Lab.</a>
					I supported ongoing postdoctoral research by working on a special screener to help diagnose children with
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyscalculia" target="_blank">Dyscalculia.</a> The screener has evolved a lot but (at various iterations) has used MongoDB, JavaScript,
					Phaser, and Firebase.
