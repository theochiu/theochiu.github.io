<p>
	Dear friends and family, 
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 45px;">
	I have exciting news to share! As most of you know I plan on
	graduating from <a href=https://purdue.edu>Purdue University</a> with a degree 
	in Computer Engineering in the December. I'm am excited to announce that as of now,
	I will be joining a team of skilled researchers at <a href="https://lunainc.com/">
	Luna Innovations</a>. Not only does this present an exciting opportunity for me
	but it is also the answer of many prayers from myself, my small group, my friends and 
	my family. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 45px;">
	Although my dad is adamant that an offer isn't legally binding and has advised me to
	jump ship if a better offer comes, as of this moment it seems that the Lord is guiding me 
	toward Luna. Luna is a big company with offices and research facilities nationwide, but
	I will be stationed at Blacksburg Virginia, that's where Virginia Tech is.
	For those interested, I will be working as a systems engineer at Luna. This
	means that I will be creating custom hardware and software solutions for the researchers
	for their projects. For those with technical knowledge think: FPGA's, SoC's, microcontrollers,
	and the associated control systems. For the non technical folks: computery engineering stuff.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 45px;">
	Though this process hasn't been easy I've been continuously reminded of the Lord's hand
	in guiding me to where I am now. Many of the classes I have taken helped me to 
	ace my technical interview with Luna. In fact one of the technologies I discovered
	in one of my high school internships helped me impress their staff. Needless to say, this
	is a moment of thankfulness for me. And I am grateful for those who have been praying, 
	unceasingly on my behalf. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 45px;">
	I also feel that I ought to specifically thank my parents. Though they are not the 
	all-knowing geniuses they might proclaim themselves to be, they have been very
	helpful in guiding me throughout my life. I doubt I'd be an engineer without them 
	(interpret that how you may). When I failed classes, they were patient with me. They 
	encouraged me to follow my passions and to excel in school - all the while reminding
	me that school and academic success isn't everything. And thank God because I'm not
	an academic success in the slightest. They stayed up late helping me with homework
	and shared exciting conversations about the glories of engineering.
