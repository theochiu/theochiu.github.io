			<p>
				All tips are by <a href="https://theochiu.github.io" target="_blank">me</a>
				and I'm not a doctor, so use at your own discretion. However, I will back up everything on
				the list with solid science. These are a list of supplements I have researched and found
				to be beneficial to humans. Some I actively use, some I will use when I am no longer
				as youthful as I am now. Proverbs 16:31, Ecclesiastes 8:15

			<h3>Cognition/Neuroplasticity</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Citicoline: Citicoline can help <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695184/">
					repair cognition</a> in traumatic injuries and brain aging. Further more it also helps strengthen the brain
					and can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061873/">
					protect it from injury</a> such as in the event of an ischemic stroke. It can also
					<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4562749/">increase your cognition</a>.
				</li>

				<li>
					Magenesium: Magnesium is important for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507270/" target="_blank">
					learning and memory</a>. Specifically Mg levels have been found to strongly positively correlate with increased 
					academic performance. Mg can also protect against alzheimers and 
					<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174684/" target="_blank">protect cognitive function</a>
					and synaptic plasticity. 
				</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Protein supplementation</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Pea protein: For bulking muscle. If you're bulking you're probably not 
					eating <a target="_blank" href=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/calpro.htm>enough protein</a>.
					Pea protein because it is keto friendly so if you're trying to lean bulk
					or bulk while losing fat, pea protein will not induce an insulin spike whereas
					<a target=_blank href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471010/>whey spikes your insulin</a> 
					as much as white bread. Pea protein is also <a target="_blank"
					href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6358922/>as effective</a> a
					source of protein for building muscle as whey.
				</li>


				<li>
					Collagen: Collagen is not for muscles. Collagen is best used for superior skin, and better joints and tendons. 
					Collagen is known to fight wrinkles as well as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213755/">
					keep skin youthful</a> and even can even reverse photo aging from the sun. Collagen is known to 
					<a target="_blank" href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566878/>reduce joint and tendon pain</a>, 
					and can even aid wound healing.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Anti-aging</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Resveratrol: Resveratrol is known to help <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5630227/">
					reduce the risk</a> of neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. As if that wasn't good enough,
					remarkably, resveratrol also can <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-016-9770-0">
					inhibit the aging process</a>.
				</li>

				<li>
					Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN): NMN is neccesary for the body to take advantage of resveratrol. Since resveratrol
					helps fight aging by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3613783/">activating sirtuin genes</a>,
					NMN is essential to be also supplemented since NMN is <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11357-020-00165-5">
					required for sirtuins to work properly</a>. 
				</li>
