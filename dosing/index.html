<h1 class="mt-5">Dosing tips</h1>
<p>
	Legend has it in 1513, Ponce de Leon searched for, but never found the fountain of youth,
	well now, 500 years later, perhaps science has found what Ponce de Leon never could.
	All tips are by <a href="https://theochiu.github.io" target="_blank">me</a>
	and I'm not a doctor, so use at your own discretion. However, I will back up everything on
	the list with solid science. These are a list of supplements I have researched and found
	to be beneficial to humans. Some I actively use, some I will use when I am no longer
	as youthful as I am now. Proverbs 16:31, Ecclesiastes 8:15

<h3>Cognition/Neuroplasticity</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Citicoline: Citicoline can help <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695184/">
		repair cognition</a> in traumatic injuries and brain aging. Further more it also helps strengthen the brain
		and can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061873/">
		protect it from injury</a> such as in the event of an ischemic stroke. It can also
		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4562749/">increase your cognition</a>.
	</li>

	<li>
		Magenesium: Magnesium is important for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507270/" target="_blank">
		learning and memory</a>. Specifically Mg levels have been found to strongly positively correlate with increased 
		academic performance. Mg can also protect against alzheimers and 
		<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174684/" target="_blank">protect cognitive function</a>
		and synaptic plasticity. 
	</li>

</ul>

<h3>Protein supplementation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Pea protein: For bulking muscle. If you're bulking you're probably not 
		eating <a target="_blank" href=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/calpro.htm>enough protein</a>.
		Pea protein because it is keto friendly so if you're trying to lean bulk
		or bulk while losing fat, pea protein will not induce an insulin spike whereas
		<a target=_blank href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471010/>whey spikes your insulin</a> 
		as much as white bread. Pea protein is also <a target="_blank"
		href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6358922/>as effective</a> a
		source of protein for building muscle as whey.
	</li>


	<li>
		Collagen: Collagen is not for muscles. Collagen is best used for superior skin, and better joints and tendons. 
		Collagen is known to fight wrinkles as well as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213755/">
		keep skin youthful</a> and even can even reverse photo aging from the sun. Collagen is known to 
		<a target="_blank" href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566878/>reduce joint and tendon pain</a>, 
		and can even aid wound healing.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Anti-aging</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Resveratrol: Resveratrol is known to help <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5630227/">
		reduce the risk</a> of neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. As if that wasn't good enough,
		remarkably, resveratrol also can <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-016-9770-0">
		inhibit the aging process</a>.
	</li>

	<li>
		Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN): NMN is neccesary for the body to take advantage of resveratrol. Since resveratrol
		helps fight aging by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3613783/">activating sirtuin genes</a>,
		NMN is essential to be also supplemented since NMN is <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11357-020-00165-5">
		required for sirtuins to work properly</a>. 
	</li>

</ul>
